# NFA
Nondeterministic Finite Automata

# Automatas are in format:
first line: number of states and ID of start state

second line: (number of states) numbers of type bool whether the state is final or not

third line: number of transitions

next (number of transitions) line: id of first state, symbol ('E' if epsilon), id of destination state
